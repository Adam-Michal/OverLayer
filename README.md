# OverLayer

## Draws a high resolution picture over your map which follows the terrain height.

This mod will load an image with name "overlay.png" placed in the following directory:

Windows: `C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Cities_Skylines\Files\`
OS X: `~/Library/Application Support/Steam/steamapps/common/Cities_Skylines/Files/`

If you copy and paste the respective path above into your file browser (Windows: `Ctrl+L`, OS X: `Cmd+Shift+G`) you will be taken to the correct path.

### About the image:

The image should be a square PNG image (alpha layer allowed and encouraged) with sides of 1152 pixels or any multiples (the higher the multiple, the bigger the resolution in-game). You can download a template overlay image with all tiles delimited [**here**](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/brunophilipe/OverLayer/master/Resources/overlay_base.png).
